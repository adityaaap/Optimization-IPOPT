# Introduction
* This repository will contain examples of optimization like Non-linear constrained optimization, Linear Programming, Quadratic Programming etc.
* These optimization algorithms are constructed in C++ using IPOPT as a solver.
* CasADi is used as an interface for solving complex optimization problems in C++ using IPOPT solver

# Current
* The current work in reposiroty contains 4 examples:
  1. Non-linear contrained Optimization - nlp.cpp
  2. Quadratic Programming - qp.cpp
  3. FMINCON equivalent in CasADi(IPOPT) - nlp_fmincon.cpp
  4. C++ equivalent code of 'Rule based Optimization for AVs' Projects's (link) - rule_based.cpp (This is a iterative non-linear constrained optimization problem)

# In Progress
* The further work in repository will focus on solving Optimal Control Problems (OCP) for trajectory optimization of autonomous robots/vehciles
