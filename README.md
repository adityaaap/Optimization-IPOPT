# Introduction
* This repository will contain examples of optimization like Non-linear constrained optimization, Linear Programming, Quadratic Programming etc.
* These optimization algorithms are constructed in C++ using IPOPT as a solver.
* CasADi is used as an interface for solving complex optimization problems in C++ using IPOPT solver

# Current
* The current work in reposiroty contains two examples - 1. Non-linear contrained Optimization and 2. Quadratic Programming

# In Progress
* The further work in repository will focus on solving Optimal Control Problems (OCP) for trajectory optimization of autonomous robots/vehciles
